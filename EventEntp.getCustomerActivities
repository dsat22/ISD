Use Case Name:
EventEnterprise.getCustomerActivities
Business Use Case Reference:	All BUCs
Description:	This service will be used by clients to fetch the activities and memos from the REEF DB for both the Customer and the Rep view of Account Activity Log.
Assumptions	1.	ESP will not hold any templates for activities in REEF. 
2.	ESP will not hold the label names for attributes defined under each activity.
3.	In case of no date range being provided in the input search criteria, then ESP will fetch data worth of last 90 days from the REEF Repository. 
4.	REEF DB shall hold only 2 years’ worth of data. Data older than 2 years shall be archived into tapes and will not be available in REEF DB and hence will not be retrievable from this service.
5.	ActivityType values can be passed based on the data fetched from EventEnterprise.getActivityReferenceData operation.
6.	Logged in user’s ABFs needs to be sent by calling clients in header level at header/sender/entitlements. So that REEF sends the activities associated to those entitlements only. Out of these entitlements, ACTIVITY_HEADER_VIEW entitlement shall also include the data elements from HeaderReference and CustomerInteraction objects.
Following are agreed upon ABFs for Activity logs,
Entitlements	Comments If Any
ACTIVITY_ACCOUNT_OWNER	
ACTIVITY_ACCOUNT_MANAGER	
ACTIVITY_SUBSCRIBER_EDITOR	
ACTIVITY_SUBSCRIBER_VIEWER	
FRAUD_MEMO_VIEW	
VIEW_ACTIVITY_LOG	
ACTIVITY_HEADER_VIEW	ABF added to control HeaderReference & some fields on CustomerInteraction object. 
Note: Even if clients are passing both the View and Create entitlements for a rep, REEF need to consider only the View entitlement functionality for AAL. 
7.	If entitlement role is ACTIVITY_SUBSCRIBER_EDITOR or ACTIVITY_SUBSCRIBER_VIEWER level, calling client need to include line level searchable parameters such as MSISDN or/and lineOfServiceID
8.	If ‘userRole’ is sent in body & header level, ESP need to consider the role in body with high priority. This body level role will be used by UI applications to filter out events.
Ex: Rep is logged in, but want to see the events at customer level (This is one of the requirement on Reb UI). So header level, ESP will be getting REP level entitlements. But at body level, ESP should get customer level entitlements. Hence when both are present, back end need to give the priority to body level entitlements (userRole).
9.	Sorting shall be allowed only on the following fields;
 	CUSTOMER_ID 
 	EVENT_DATE
 	LINE_OF_SERVICE_ID 
 	FAN  
 	MSISDN  
 	ACTIVITY_TYPE
10.	If the calling client pass any other combinations than the ones listed in the ‘Landing Page Query’ section, then REEF shall still execute the query for that combination and return the results.
11.	The ‘totalCount’ field in the response will signify the total number of records that were returned from the REEF repository, for the specific search criteria given in the input.
12.	The ‘totalCount’ field shall be used by calling clients to get an idea on how many pages they need to render in order to display the entire result set.
13.	When ‘sortType’ is defined as ‘EVENT_DATE’ then the interpretation of ‘sortOrder’ is as follows;
ASC = Oldest to Latest
DESC = Latest to Oldest

Dependencies	None
Actors:	Client: Core APIs (for Reb-UI), E// WSIL (for SAP-CARE)
ESP, REEF
Preconditions:	None
Inputs:	Refer to the service level data mapping sheet.
Main Flow:	1.	Client will call this ESP service operation with appropriate search criteria input to retrieve activities and memos from the REEF repository.
2.	ESP shall check if there is any ABF passed in the body (userRole), if present ESP shall use that ABF and proceed to step 4.
3.	In step 2 if there is no ABF present, then ESP shall pick up the ABFs from ‘/header/sender/entitlements’ and then proceed to step 4.
4.	If isFiltered = False, then ESP shall use the input fields passed in the search criteria and construct the query for the landing page and proceed to step 6. (Refer to the landing page query conditions table below).
5.	If isFiltered = True, then ESP shall use the input fields passed in the search criteria and construct the query, by using the landing page query and appending the other filter conditions using the ‘AND’ clause. Then proceed to step 6.
6.	ESP shall use the entitlements selected above and execute the constructed query to fetch the activities and memos from the REEF repository for that customer and send back the results to client in the response. 
7.	End of main flow.
Alternative Flows:	
AF 1: If there are no record fetched, for the input criteria, ESP returns back with no record found message to calling client with a totalCount = 0 in response.

AF 2: If the entitlements are not present in the header, or not provided as per the ABFs configured in REEF, then ESP will return back as ‘No Data Found’ error message.

Outputs	Refer to the service level data mapping sheet.
Post Conditions	Based on the search criteria passed in the input, the required data is fetched from REEF DB and is sent back in the response to the calling client.
